## Example Password Hasher 

If you need to write a custom hasher (also known as a password encryptor) to import users into FusionAuth, you may use this example build. This is intended to be used with the Writing a Plugin guide provided in the FusionAuth documentation. 

Writing a Plugin guide is found here:  https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/plugins/writing-a-plugin
